# About Me
My name is Dan and I'm a Data Science major at Wake Tech. I'm returning to school after almost 20 years so this is a big learning curve for me. I'm also a father of two boys (12 & 16) and a veteran and I work full time in the food world of downtown Raleigh. 
## My Interests
I have many hobbies and interests and I love learning new things. I’m passionate about cooking, taking care of my plants, and video games. My **strongest** passion is cooking and just about anything to do in the kitchen. I love to ferment foods and cook new things. My plants are also one of my biggest joys. I have somewhere in the ballpark of _**100**_ in my house and it doesn't seem to be slowing down (if anyone would like any propogations contact me below!). My plants also help keep me on a routine. Academically, I’m fascinated by sociology, science, and artificial intelligence.
